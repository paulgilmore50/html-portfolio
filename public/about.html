<h1>About Me!</h1>

<h2>From Supporting Systems to Building Them!</h2>

<p>Greetings! I am a Technical Support Analyst at Florida State University with over a decade of 
   experience across the IT spectrum—from managing networks to administering systems. While I have 
   spent years ensuring technology works for others, I am now focused on building the tools of 
   tomorrow.</p>

<p>Currently, I am deep-diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on Python soon to follow
   to transition into Full Stack Web Development. I pair my hardware and networking roots 
   (CompTIA ITF+, TestOut PC Pro Certifications) with a growing mastery of data (W3Schools Certified
   SQL Developer) to soon build robust, efficient, and user-centric applications and websites.</p>

<p>When I am not coding or troubleshooting at FSU, you will most likely find me at my home in
   Tallahassee with my wife and our three dogs!</p>
